## Introduction: <br />
This project focuses on classifying music genres using convolutional neural networks, specifically employing the ResNet50V2 architecture.

## Data Description: <br />
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from GTZAN (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification?select=Data), accessible here. We have narrowed our focus to five primary genres: Jazz, Rock, Hip Hop, Country, and Classical. Each genre consists of 100 audio samples. To construct our training and testing sets, we have allocated 85% of the data for training, resulting in 425 audio samples, and 15% for testing, resulting in 75 audio samples.
